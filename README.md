Welcome to the MEMORY GAME. (project 3 from Udacity FEND nano-degree program).

This is my first attempt at writing any form of vanilla JavaScript with DOM manipulation.

***********************************************

The aim of the game is to find 8 matching pairs from 16 cards. With a match the cards will stay visible. If the cards do not match they will turn over and remain hidden.

You are challenged to get a 3 star rating. Completing the game within 16 moves will see you achieve 3 stars. In under 21 moves you will get two stars. Anything else above is one star.

A move is deemed when two cards are turned to see if they match.

You are also timed. At the end of the game you will see how well you did with your score, star rating and time.

There is also an option to play again.
